            <h2>The Lifejourney of Andiar Rinanda</h2>
            <p>Andiar Rinanda Agastya, the name my parents gave me 18 years ago. February 12, 2005, the day I was born and the name 
                "Andiar" was first given to me. My parents said that my name has a good meaning, overall my name has the meaning that 
                I am a tough and firm person and have high loyalty. That's what I think, I am a disciplined, firm and tough person. 
                Since I was little, my parents taught me to be independent and never be pampered. In the past, I was annoyed because of 
                my parents' parenting, but apparently I realized too late. What my parents have taught me has made me a stronger person 
                in living my life, which is certainly not easy and has many steep paths.</p>
            <p>I am an intelligent and diligent ITS information systems student. At ITS this is one of the great experiences I have had 
                in my life. Because of course it is not easy to enter and study at ITS, and it requires a lot of sacrifice and struggle. 
                That is why I am very proud to gain knowledge and continue learning (even though it is a little difficult) until I can 
                apply the knowledge I have gained and can make my parents proud, especially my late father.</p>
            <p>As an Information Systems student, I certainly have an interest and interest in technology and digital fields. 
                One of them is the field of web programming. This field is the same field that is being pursued to this day. 
                There are more or less 3 websites that I have worked on, although all three are not perfect and still have many 
                shortcomings. For me, web programming is my passion which I will continue to pursue in the future. Apart from web 
                programming, I also have an interest in writing. I have been actively writing articles for both personal and public 
                purposes since I was in junior high school. Several times I won competitions and championships related to literature 
                and writing. One of them is that I have won a regency level poetry reading and writing competition, a letter writing 
                competition for the MENDIKBUD, a literacy competition held by the Library and Archives Service, and many more. Maybe
                 my ability in literature was inherited from my parents, who were Indonesian language teachers and lecturers.</p>
            <p>While studying at ITS, I studied a lot again and explored my abilities and interests. And one of the interests 
                I discovered was robotics. Yes, I am a member of ITS Robotics UKM, as well as serving as Teaching Robotics Staff. 
                I have also been Staff in the Mechanical and Robot Manufacturing Division in one of the ITS robotics research teams.
                 Because my specialty is in the mechanical and manufacturing fields, I have been involved a lot in robot design and 
                 repair. I worked on a lot of robot mechanical design projects, even down to the manufacturing process. Even though 
                 I am not yet qualified in this field, at least I have mastered the mechanics and manufacturing of a robot.</p>
            <p>Currently, several of my friends and I are focusing on creating and developing AI and applications. I am a person who likes to innovate and likes to come up with ideas. So I also often win several business plan and business case competitions. This is also one of the interests that I discovered while attending college.</p>
