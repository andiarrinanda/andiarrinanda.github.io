            <h2>ISLAM, THE KEY TO SELF-DISCOVERY</h2>
            <p>How Islam was Introduced In My Life (2012 - 2018)
                My name is Andiar Rinanda Agastya, born on February 12, 2005, in Blitar. I was born a Muslim and grew up in a predominantly Muslim environment. When I was a child, Islamic life was very close to me, even though my parents were not good at religion. Although my parents were not very pious people, my parents were always firm in educating their children, especially in matters of religion. Since childhood, my brother and I have been taught the fundamentals of being a Muslim, such as reciting the Quran, praying, and having good morals. 
                My parents used to say "Even though your father and mother are not good at religion, you as a child must be better than your parents. Because mom and dad have felt how hard the world is when your religion is weak." This was often conveyed to me and my brother when we were young because we used to be very stubborn and liked to forget worship such as prayer and recitation. I used to ignore my parents' words and didn't take them seriously. However, I realize the meaning of what my parents did and said only now. When now my life began to be busy, many problems and trials came, and the burden felt heavier, that's when I realized I was gradually moving away from Allah and Islam. 
                Now, I am still trying to return to the path of righteousness with many regrets, because I realized too late that what my parents taught me was the key to my life. To this day, I still have many regrets. Although it is bitter to accept the fact, the reality is that I returned to the path of Allah when I was in a difficult situation and had many problems. But when the sustenance of pleasure was given, I forgot the majesty of Allah SWT. Even today, I am still learning a lot to strengthen my religious values. Because I realize that the key to all the doors of my life is the value of religion. When I have lost that key, then what is the meaning of life in this world?

               <P>The Reality of My Life After I Returned to Allah SWT (2019)
                When I was in the third year of junior high school, I started to slowly improve myself and my religion. At that time, the temptation to return to the good and right path was very great, it was because I had classmates who were many of them far from the right path of Allah SWT. Although they were also Muslims, most of them chose to ignore worship and the values of Islam. However, although I remained good friends with them, I was never instigated to follow the path they chose. Because I already have a firm stance on what I have chosen, which is to return to the path of Allah. 
                Until I entered high school, I remained firm in my stance on the path of Allah SWT. Even though at that time I had many obstacles and problems that came along the way, I remained calm in living my life at that time. I realized that the calmness I got was absolute because I was able to return to the path of Allah. I remained patient and calm through all the ups and downs of my life because I believed Allah was with me. At that time I strengthened my religious knowledge together with my parents. Starting from regularly reciting the Koran, strengthening worship both mandatory and sunnah, and strengthening other religious values. At that time I remained calm in living my life even though many obstacles, temptations, and problems had to be faced.
                However, Allah suddenly gave me a very difficult ordeal when I entered my final year of high school. I was faced with obstacles that took away many of my dreams. I often found that reality did not match my expectations. Starting from my grades that were always bad even though I had studied to the maximum and really to the emergence of many problems in my family. At that time I was dissolved in sadness so much that I forgot about Allah SWT a little because I was too busy thinking about the world. Until the peak, I started to get away from Allah SWT again, when I got a big obstacle when I was about to enter college. I was tested by Allah by being confronted with the fact that I was difficult and often failed to enter college. I took various selection and admission tests, but none of them passed. I failed to enter university fourteen times. And at that time, I became distant and doubted Allah SWT. I lived a life full of pressure, stress, and sadness accepting that failure. Almost every day I just stayed in my room crying about the harsh reality. Since then I have been far away from Allah SWT.

                How God Gave Me Life Messages Through Various Means and Mediums ( 2022 ) 
                After I was faced with a formidable obstacle in my life because I kept failing to register for university, I was given sustenance by Allah SWT so that I could be accepted at ITS. I could feel immense happiness at that time, after trying and continuing to endure all the pressure that was there I was finally able to feel happiness. At that time I realized that my father said the right thing, "if we want to get a big fortune, we must have the courage to be patient". My father reminded me to always be patient and willing to accept reality when I was faced with obstacles because it was difficult to get into a university. I am very grateful to Allah and grateful to my parents for continuing to strengthen me during that time. I realized that it was my fault for not being able to continue to uphold my religious values so I became restless and far from Allah SWT. Since then I have tried again to be myself back in the way of Allah SWT.
                However, when I was accepted at ITS, my father had a disaster because of an illness he had suffered from a long time ago. At that time I accompanied my father to the hospital with my mother. I take care of my father sincerely with all my heart. Because I couldn't bear to see my father, the most influential person in my life, lay sick. I hope and pray to Allah to remove my father's illness, so he can come back with us again. However, when the announcement of passing the ITS selection, my father could not witness this success and happiness. My father was unconscious because of a coma. I am very down, sad, and devastated to see this fact. Until finally Friday, July 22, 2022, seven hours after I was accepted at ITS my father passed away. I was devastated and felt that my life had been destroyed instantly when I saw this fact. It hurts to know that my father had to pass away when I could be accepted at ITS.
                I feel so guilty for my father and myself. Until finally I realized that Allah SWT had prepared my mentality and patience and sincerity of heart. Allah gave me obstacles so that I could be more patient and willing to accept the fact that it was difficult for me to get to university until I failed fourteen times. However, it turned out that God had prepared all of this so I had to be patient with letting go of the bigger thing, namely the loss of my father. I never realized that Allah conveys many of His messages through the obstacles and problems He gives. I have always realized that God wants me to return to the right path so that I don't go astray any further.
